## Just One of Many

- Today we will go over AVL tree insertion and deletion
	- The best way to learn AVL trees: practice, practice, practice!

- AVL trees are just one type of balanced search tree:
	- Red-Black trees (not as strict as AVL);
	- Splay trees (change tree on search as well);
	- 2-3 trees (2 or 3 children per node);
	- B-trees (generalization of 2-3 trees);
	- B+ trees (a B-tree on disk in which full data is stored only in the leaves, which are linked together as a linked list)

## Coding

- Coding a BST isn't that bad
- Coding an AVL tree is much harder

## Not Just Numbers

- Students always ask why are we inserting numbers into a BST?
	- In reality the number is just a key that identifies a much larger piece of data
	- The key might be your student ID number, which identifies your student record
- We can use strings (just like in a hash table) on a search tree as easily as we can use numbers
	- We'll have fun with some strings today

# Examples

## Example 1

Insert 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9

- Insert 8
	- 8 is the root

- Insert 6
	- 6 is less than 8, so it becomes the left child
	- 6 is even, 8 is left high

- Insert 7
	- 7 is less than 8, and higher than 6, so 7 becomes the right child of 6
	- Now 8 is unbalanced
	- Rotate 6 left: now the tree is root 8, 7 is the left child, 6 is the left child of 7
	- Rotate 8 right: now 7 is the root, 6 is the left child, 8 is the right child

- Insert 5
	- 5 is less than 7 and less than 6, so 5 becomes the left child of 6
	- 6 and 7 are left high, the other nodes are even

- Insert 3
	- 3 is less than 7, less than 6, and less than 5, so it becomes the left child of 5
	- 6 and 7 are unbalanced
	- Rotate 6 right: Now 7 is the root, 8 is the right child, 5 is the left child, 3 is the left child of 5, 6 is the right child of 5

- Insert 0
	- 0 is less than 7, less than 5, less than 3, so it becomes the left child of 3
	- Now the root is unbalanced
	- Rotate 7 (the root) right: Now, 5 is the root, 3 is the left child, 0 is the left child of 3, 7 is the right child of the root, 6 is the left child of 7, 8 is the left child of 7

- Insert 9
	- 9 is greater than 5, greater than 7, greater than 8, so it becomes the right child of 8.
	- 5, 7, and 8 are right high

- Resulting Tree Stats:
	- Height = 4
	- Root = 5
	- Leaves = {0, 6, 9}
	- Single Rotations = 2
	- Double Rotations = 1

- Possible scenarios
	- Inserting 4 -> no rotation
	- Inserting 10 -> single rotation
	- Inserting 2 -> double rotation

## Example 2

- We have a tree: 
	- 5 is the root
		- 3 is the left child
			- 0 is the left child
		- 7 is the right child
			- 6 is the left child
			- 8 is the right child
				- 9 is the right child

- Delete 3: The resulting tree is:
	- 5 is the root
		- 0 is the left child
		- 7 is the right subchild
			- 6 is the left subchild
			- 8 is the right subchild
				- 9 is the right subchild

- The tree is right of right: 5 needs to be rotated left
	- 7 is the root
		- 5 is the left child
			- 0 is the left child
			- 6 is the right child
		- 8 is the right child
			- 9 is the right child

- Delete 9: The resulting tree is:
	- 7 is the root
		- 5 is the left child
			- 0 is the left child
			- 6 is the right child
		- 8 is the right child

- The emphasis will be on insertion, but it is good to practice deletion regardless

## Example 3

- Insert: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70
	- This is a worst case for a BST, but not for an AVL tree!

- Insert 10: The resulting tree is:
	- 10 is the root

- Insert 20: The resulting tree is:
	- 10 is the root
		- 20 is the right child

- Insert 30: The resulting tree is:
	- 10 is the root
		- 20 is the right child
			- 30 is the right child

- The tree is right of right: rotate 10 left:
	- 20 is the root
		- 10 is the left child
		- 30 is the right child

- Insert 40: the resultign tree is:
	- 20 is the root
		- 10 is the left child
		- 30 is the right child
			- 40 is the right child

- Insert 50: the resultign tree is:
	- 20 is the root
		- 10 is the left child
		- 30 is the right child
			- 40 is the right child
				- 50 is the right child

- The tree is right of right: rotate 30 left:
	- 20 is the root
		- 10 is the left child
		- 40 is the right child
			- 30 is the left child
			- 50 is the right child

- etc.

## Example 4: With Words!

- Insert dog, cat, bat, fox, elk, gnu, ant

- Insert dog:
	- "dog" is the root

- Insert cat:
	- "dog" is the root
		- "cat" is the left child

- Insert bat:
	- "dog" is the root
		- "cat" is the left child
			- "bat" is the left child

- The root is left of left: rotate "dog" right:
	- "cat" is the root
		- "bat" is the left child
		- "dog" is the right child

- Insert fox:
	- "cat" is the root
		- "bat" is the left child
		- "dog" is the right child
			- "fox" is the right child

- Insert elk:
	- "cat" is the root
		- "bat" is the left child
		- "dog" is the right child
			- "fox" is the right child
				- "elk" is the left child

- "dog" is left of right
	- first rotate "fox" right, then rotate "dog" left
	- "cat" is the root
		- "bat" is the left child
		- "elk" is the right child
			- "dog" is the left child
			- "fox" is the right child

- Insert gnu:
	- "cat" is the root
		- "bat" is the left child
		- "elk" is the right child
			- "dog" is the left child
			- "fox" is the right child
				- "gnu" is the right child

- the root is right of right: rotate "cat" left:
	- "elk" is the root
		- "cat" is the left child
			- "bat" is the left child
			- "dog" is the right child
		- "fox" is the right child
			- "gnu" is the right child

- etc.

## Example 5: The Mammoth Example

- Insert doe, emu, gar, fly, boa, cow, sow, jay, hog, yak, lar, nit, ass, owl, pug, rat, man

- Try this on your own. I will only write out one guide to constructing the tree (as opposed to rewriting each time a new entry is added

- "jay" is the root
	- emu" is the left child
		- "cow" is the left child
			- "boa" is the left child
				- "ass" is the left child
			- "doe" is the right child
		- "gar" is the right child
			- "fly" is the left child
			- "hog" is the right child
	- "sow" is the right child
		- "lar" is the left child
			- "nit" is the right child
		- "yak" is the right child

- This is the AVL tree with most of the entries. Try adding the rest yourself
